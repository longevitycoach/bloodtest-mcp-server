# Health & Lifestyle Workflow

This document describes the Health & Lifestyle workflow implementation for the MCP server, providing a structured approach to personal health and lifestyle improvement.

## Overview

The Health & Lifestyle workflow is a comprehensive system that guides users through a structured journey of health improvement, from initial assessment to long-term maintenance. The workflow is divided into six main phases:

1. **Initial Assessment and Goal Setting**
2. **Comprehensive Health Analysis**
3. **Personalized Strategy Development**
4. **Implementation and Self-Management**
5. **Ongoing Monitoring and Adjustment**
6. **Long-Term Integration and Prevention**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- FAISS for vector search (if using RAG features)

### Running the Server

1. **Using the provided script (recommended):**

   ```bash
   python run_health_lifestyle.py
   ```

2. **Using environment variables:**

   ```bash
   CONFIG_PATH=resources/health_lifestyle_workflow.yaml python -m server
   ```

3. **Using Docker (if configured):**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up health-lifestyle
   ```
